# Simple Reflex Agent Tutorial

## Overview

This tutorial demonstrates the implementation of a **Simple Reflex Agent** using Python and Matplotlib. A reflex agent is one of the most basic types of AI agents that acts based on the current perception of the environment without considering the history of past perceptions.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this tutorial, you will:

- Understand the concept of reflex agents in AI
- Learn how to implement condition-action rules
- Visualize agent behavior in a grid environment
- Explore the limitations of reactive behavior

## What is a Simple Reflex Agent?

A Simple Reflex Agent operates on simple **condition-action rules** (if-then rules):

- **IF** the current room is dirty, **THEN** clean it
- **IF** the current room is clean, **THEN** move to the next room

The agent has no memory and makes decisions based solely on current perceptions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```bash
pip install matplotlib
```

### Project Structure

```
0.1 Simple Reflex Agent/
├── demo_simple_reflex_agent.py    # Main implementation
└── README.md                      # This tutorial
```

## Implementation Details

### 1. Environment Setup

The environment consists of a 2×2 grid with 4 rooms:

- **Room1** (Top-left): Initially Clean
- **Room2** (Top-right): Initially Dirty
- **Room3** (Bottom-left): Initially Clean
- **Room4** (Bottom-right): Initially Clean

### 2. Agent Logic

```python
def reflex_agent(state):
    if state == "Dirty":
        return "Clean"
    else:
        return "Move"
```

This simple function embodies the reflex behavior:

- **Perceive**: Check if current room is dirty
- **Act**: Clean if dirty, otherwise move

### 3. Visualization

The implementation includes real-time visualization:

- **Green rooms**: Clean
- **Red rooms**: Dirty
- **Blue circle**: Agent position

## How to Run

1. **Execute the script**:

   ```bash
   python demo_simple_reflex_agent.py
   ```

2. **Watch the simulation**:
   - The agent will move through rooms sequentially
   - When it encounters dirt, it cleans the room
   - The visualization updates in real-time

## Expected Behavior

The simulation runs for 8 steps:

1. **Step 1**: Agent in Room1 (Clean) → Move to Room2
2. **Step 2**: Agent in Room2 (Dirty) → Clean Room2
3. **Step 3**: Agent in Room2 (Clean) → Move to Room3
4. **Step 4**: Agent in Room3 (Clean) → Move to Room4
5. **Step 5**: Agent in Room4 (Clean) → Move to Room1
6. **Steps 6-8**: Continue cycling through clean rooms

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

### 1. **Reactive Behavior**

- No planning or goal-setting
- Immediate response to stimuli
- No consideration of future consequences

### 2. **Condition-Action Rules**

- Simple if-then logic
- Direct mapping from percepts to actions
- No complex reasoning required

### 3. **Limitations**

- **No memory**: Cannot remember previously visited rooms
- **No efficiency**: May revisit clean rooms unnecessarily
- **No optimization**: No strategic path planning

## Analysis Questions

After running the simulation, consider:

1. **Efficiency**: Is the agent's cleaning strategy optimal?
2. **Completeness**: Will the agent eventually clean all dirty rooms?
3. **Scalability**: How would this approach work with more rooms?
4. **Intelligence**: What makes this "intelligent" vs. a simple program?

## Limitations of Simple Reflex Agents

### Pros

- **Simple to implement**
- **Fast decision making**
- **Low computational requirements**
- **Predictable behavior**

### Cons

- **No learning capability**
- **Cannot handle complex environments**
- **Inefficient navigation**
- **Cannot adapt to changing goals**

## Next Steps

After mastering simple reflex agents, explore:

1. **Goal-based agents** (see `0.2 Goal_based_agent/`)
2. **Learning agents** (see `0.3 Learning Agent/`)
3. **Multi-agent systems**
4. **Utility-based agents**

## Exercises

### Beginner

1. Modify the environment to have different initial dirt patterns
2. Change the agent's movement pattern (e.g., random movement)
3. Add more rooms to the grid

### Intermediate

1. Implement a performance measure to evaluate cleaning efficiency
2. Add obstacles that the agent must navigate around
3. Create multiple types of dirt requiring different cleaning actions

### Advanced

1. Compare the reflex agent's performance with random behavior
2. Implement a simple memory mechanism
3. Design a reflex agent for a different domain (e.g., traffic light controller)
